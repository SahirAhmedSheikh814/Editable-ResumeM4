# Milestone 4: Editable Resume

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance the Dynamic Resume Builder by adding **editability** to the generated resume. Once the resume is created, users can click on individual sections (e.g., Education, Work Experience) and modify the content directly.

## Features
- **Editable Resume Sections**: Users can click on different sections of the resume to update the information.
- **Real-time Updates**: Any changes made to the resume are reflected immediately without reloading the page.
- **TypeScript Code Quality**: Organized, efficient, and error-free TypeScript code that ensures smooth functionality and ease of maintenance.

## Project Requirements
1. **Editable Resume Sections**:
   - Enable users to click on each section (Personal Information, Education, Work Experience, Skills) and edit the content directly.
   - Changes should be applied in real-time and displayed instantly on the resume.
2. **TypeScript Implementation**:
   - Use TypeScript to ensure organized, efficient, and reliable code for real-time editing functionality.

## Scoring Breakdown
- **Editable Functionality Implementation** (60 Points)
  - Each section of the resume is editable, allowing users to click and modify content.
  - Changes are reflected immediately without needing a page refresh.

- **TypeScript Code Quality and Logic** (40 Points)
